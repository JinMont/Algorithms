# Balanced Brackets

# ==============
# Before dive in 
# ==============
# 1) Possible unbalace
#  a) a closing bracket without a prior matching opening bracket
#  b) left with some opening brackets that haven't been matched
# 2) Which data strucutre?
#  a) should keep track of all the brackets and check an unbalace at each loop
# 3) Stack
#  a) characteristics of stack can help solving the problems and the question above
