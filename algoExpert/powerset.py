# 1) add n elements in 2^n subsets therefore O(2^n * n)

# 1) O(2^n * n) since there are 2^n subsets and n elements in array

The power set of a set with n elements contains 2^n elements
https://mathedia.com/the-power-set-of-a-set-with-n-elements-contains-2n-elements/

Proof
base case: n = 0
The set which contains 0 elements is the empty set ∅={ }.

Its power set contains 1 element (1 = 20), namely the empty set: 𝑃(∅)={∅}={{ }}.

Iinductive step: A(n) => A(n+1)
Let 𝑀𝑛+1 be a set with n+1 elements. 𝑒1, 𝑒2, … 𝑒𝑛, 𝑒𝑛+1.

It hast the subset 𝑀𝑛 with n elements 𝑒1, 𝑒2, … 𝑒𝑛.

𝑃(𝑀𝑛) has 2𝑛 elements (assumption), namely the 2𝑛 subsets of 𝑀𝑛: 𝑇1, 𝑇2,… 𝑇2𝑛.

They are the subsets of 𝑀𝑛 that implies that they are subsets of 𝑀𝑛+1 so they are elements of 𝑃(𝑀𝑛+1).

Additionally contains 𝑃(𝑀𝑛+1) the subsets ofon 𝑀𝑛+1 that contain the element 𝑒𝑛+1

Those can be constructed by joining 𝑇𝑖𝑖∈{1…2𝑛} with 𝑒𝑛+1

Each subset 𝑇𝑖 adds one element: 𝑒𝑛+1. 𝑇𝑖‘=𝑇𝑖∪𝑒𝑛+1. The number of subsets doubles.

We have:
𝑃(𝑀𝑛+1)={𝑇1, 𝑇2,… 𝑇2𝑛, 𝑇1‘, 𝑇2‘,… 𝑇′2𝑛}
The power set has 2𝑛+2𝑛=2⋅2𝑛=2𝑛+1 elements.
